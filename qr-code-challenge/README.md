## My process
-HTML Markup 
-A lot of youtube to help style 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned how to manipulate divs
and use CSS custom properties.


### Continued development
I need more practice understanding CSS Flexbox, padding, margins, width/height values, etc. 
I also need to get more comfortable with Github. Keeping up with these challenges will give me great pratical working experience with these concepts. 

This is the first challenge or real project I've attempted since I began learning web development 8 weeks ago. And doing this challenge showed me that I definitely need more time to study CSS. I used youtube to help me figure out my first steps. So, it was like being thrown to the wolves. I think that feeling is helpful having to think carefully about each styling rule I used and to make sense of it all. I'll get the hang of it.
